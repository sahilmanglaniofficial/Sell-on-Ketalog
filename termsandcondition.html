            <p class="mb-6">
                Thank you for using Ketalog.in. </br></br>
                For your information: “Ketalog” is an e-commerce platform operated and managed in accordance with
                applicable laws in India, providing a technology-enabled marketplace for users to purchase products
                across multiple categories. Throughout these Terms and Conditions, “We”, “Us”, “Our”, or “Ketalog” refer

            <p class="mb-6">
                Ketalog.in is a multi-category e-commerce marketplace that enables users to browse, order, and receive a
                wide range of products including daily essentials such as fresh fruits and vegetables (quick-commerce),
                apparel such as shirts and lifestyle clothing, and general merchandise. Delivery of orders placed on the
                Platform is facilitated through independent third-party delivery partners, who operate on a
                principal-to-principal basis. Ketalog acts solely as a facilitator and does not directly employ delivery
                partners unless explicitly stated.

                Blinkit, Flipkart, or any other third-party marketplaces, except where explicitly stated. Any reference
                to other platforms is purely for contextual or explanatory purposes and does not imply association,
                partnership, or endorsement.

            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">

                <li class="mb-6">
                    The Ketalog Platform is a technology-enabled multi-category e-commerce marketplace that allows users
                    and consumers to place orders for products offered by independent sellers, shopkeepers, and service
                    providers through the Platform. Products and services available on the Platform may be listed or
                    offered for sale by Ketalog, its affiliates, or independent third-party sellers and vendors
                    (collectively referred to as “Third Party Sellers”). Ketalog does not own, manufacture, or store
                    inventory for such products and operates solely as a facilitator providing digital infrastructure to
                    enable transactions between users and Third Party Sellers, except where explicitly stated otherwise.
                    </br>
                </li>
                <li class="mb-6">
                    When a user places an order on the Ketalog Platform, the order details are electronically
                    transmitted to the relevant Third Party Seller or shopkeeper for processing and fulfillment. The
                    Third Party Seller prepares the order, after which an independent delivery partner collects the
                    product(s) from the seller’s premises and delivers them to the customer at the designated delivery
                    address. For abundant clarity, Ketalog does not store, warehouse, package, or physically handle
                    products listed on the Platform and does not participate in the fulfillment process beyond
                    facilitating order placement, communication, and logistics coordination through the
                    Platform.</br></br>
                </li>
                <li class="mb-6">
                    For further clarity, Ketalog is not and shall not be deemed to be a party to any transaction between
                    the user and the Third Party Seller, such transaction being a direct and independent arrangement
                    between the user and the seller. Ketalog does not exercise control over, nor does it make any
                    representations or warranties regarding, the quality, quantity, availability, suitability,
                    merchantability, or fitness for any purpose of the products or services offered by Third Party
                    Sellers. Ketalog does not endorse or guarantee any Third Party Offerings and expressly disclaims all
                    warranties and liabilities arising from or related to such offerings. Services made available
                    through the Ketalog Platform may be limited to select geographic locations within India and are
                    subject to operational feasibility.

            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">

                <li class="mb-6">
                    To place an order or access certain features on the Ketalog Platform, users are required to
                    register and log in using their mobile number and one-time password (OTP) authentication. For
                    buyers, the
                    registration process is designed to be simple and quick, allowing users to log in using their
                    mobile number, verify their identity via OTP, and proceed to browse and purchase products. To
                    complete
                    an order, buyers must provide accurate delivery details, including a valid address and contact
                    information, to enable successful order fulfillment and delivery.</br>
                </li>

                <li class="mb-6">
                    Sellers may also register on the Ketalog Platform by logging in through mobile number and OTP
                    verification. Upon successful login, sellers are required to complete their profile by providing
                    business-related details, product information, and other necessary documentation as requested on
                    the Platform. Sellers interested in offering products for sale on Ketalog can create a seller
                    account by visiting https://ketalog.in/sellonketalog.
                    Sellers are responsible for ensuring that all information provided during registration and
                    thereafter remains accurate, complete, and up to date, and Ketalog reserves the right to verify,
                    approve, suspend, or reject seller accounts at its discretion.</br></br>
                </li>

                <li class="mb-6">
                    By registering and using the Ketalog Platform, you consent to receive transactional communications,
                    including order confirmations, delivery updates, customer support communications, and
                    service-related notifications, via phone calls, SMS, in-app notifications, or other electronic
                    communication methods. You may also receive promotional communications, which you can opt out of
                    using the options provided within such communications or through your account settings. Ketalog may
                    collect and process personal and transactional information necessary to operate and improve the
                    Platform, and all such data shall be handled in accordance with Ketalog’s Privacy Policy.</br></br>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Delivery Partners</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">

                <li class="mb-6">
                    Ketalog facilitates the delivery of orders placed on the Ketalog Platform through independent
                    delivery partners who operate on a principal-to-principal basis. For abundant clarity, delivery
                    partners are not employees, agents, or representatives of Ketalog and are associated with the
                    Platform solely as independent service providers. Delivery partners are not exclusively bound to
                    Ketalog and may choose to provide delivery services at their own discretion. There exists no
                    principal–agent, employer–employee, partnership, or joint venture relationship between Ketalog and
                    any delivery partner, and accordingly, Ketalog shall not be held liable for any acts, omissions,
                    delays, or conduct of delivery partners.</br>
                </li>
                <li class="mb-6">
                    As part of its current operational model, Ketalog does not charge delivery partners any registration
                    fees, commission, platform fees, or additional charges for availing or providing delivery services
                    through the Platform. Ketalog compensates delivery partners in accordance with mutually agreed
                    terms, based on delivery parameters such as distance, time, or order requirements, as determined
                    from time to time. Users are expected to treat all delivery partners with dignity, courtesy, and
                    respect and to support a safe, harassment-free working environment. Any discourteous, abusive,
                    unlawful, or inappropriate behavior toward a delivery partner may result in suspension or
                    termination of user access to the Platform at Ketalog’s sole discretion. Any claims, damages, or
                    compensation arising due to a user’s misconduct toward a delivery partner shall be the sole
                    responsibility of the user, and Ketalog shall not bear any liability in this regard.</br></br>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">ADDITIONAL TERMS</h2>
            <p class="mb-6">
                The following additional terms shall apply in addition to and not in substitution of the other terms and
                conditions governing access to and use of the Ketalog Platform. In the event of any inconsistency, these
                Additional Terms shall prevail to the extent of such inconsistency.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Restricted and Regulated Products</h3>
            <p class="mb-6">
                The Ketalog Platform may, from time to time, display or enable access to products that are subject to
                age restrictions or regulatory controls under applicable laws in India (“Restricted Products”). Users
                agree and undertake that they shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations while
                accessing or purchasing any such products through the Platform.</br></br>
                By attempting to place an order for any Restricted Product, the user confirms and represents that:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li class="mb-4">
                    He/she is at least eighteen (18) years of age or above, or such higher age as may be prescribed
                    under applicable law; and </li>
                <li class="mb-4">
                    He/she is legally eligible to purchase and receive such products at the delivery location provided,
                    including compliance with any location-based or proximity-based restrictions imposed by law.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-6">
                Users shall not use the Ketalog Platform to purchase or attempt to purchase any Restricted Product for
                themselves or on behalf of any other person who does not meet the applicable legal age or eligibility
                requirements. Ketalog does not permit misuse of the Platform for circumvention of legal safeguards,
                including misrepresentation of age, identity, or delivery location.</br></br>

                In the event Ketalog becomes aware that a user has made a false declaration, misrepresented age or
                eligibility, or otherwise violated applicable laws in connection with Restricted Products, Ketalog
                reserves the right to take appropriate action, including but not limited to cancellation of orders,
                suspension or termination of user access, and reporting such activity to relevant authorities, where
                required under law.</br></br>
